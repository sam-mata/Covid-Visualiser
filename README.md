# Covid Visualiser

An interactive web app for visualising worldwide trends in Covid-19 data.

This project can be viewed live [here](https://covid-visualiser.vercel.app/).

---

## 1. Installation

```bash
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

> [!NOTE] > _The `--shamefully-hoist` flag **is** required, despite the name, as this flattens the node modules for production._

---

## 2. Usage

Starting the development server on [localhost](http://localhost:3000) can be done with:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

> [!NOTE] > _Nuxt will first have to initialise, which can take some time before the project structure is loaded and hot-reloading is available._

Running a production build instead can be done with:

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run preview
```
